The Government does not intend to establish a competitive range, conduct discussions, request Quote revisions, or use any other source selection technique associated with FAR subpart 15.3. Note that the rules regarding vendor communications described in FAR Part 15.3 shall not apply to this acquisition. ICE reserves the right to contact any Quoter at any point to request additional information regarding their Quotes. Once the Government determines the Quoter that is the best-suited (i.e., the apparent successful Quoter), the Government reserves the right to communicate with only that Quoter to address any remaining issues, if necessary, and finalize a Task Order with that Quoter. These issues may include technical and price. If the parties cannot successfully address any remaining issues, as determined pertinent at the sole discretion of the Government, the Government reserves the right to communicate with the next best- suited Quoter based on the original analysis and address any remaining issues. Such interchanges would not be considered negotiations as contemplated under FAR subpart 15.3. Contractors are strongly encouraged to submit their best technical and price Quotes.\n\n2.4 EVALUTION PROCESS\n\nICE will use the trade-off methodology to determine best value through a two-phased approach for this procurement. ICE will use the following evaluation factors:\n\nPhase I\n\n\uf0a7 Factor 1: Corporate Experience"
