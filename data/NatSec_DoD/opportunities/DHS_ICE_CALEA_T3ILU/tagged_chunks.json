PII refers to information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual\u2019s identity, either alone, or when combined with other information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual; and SPII is a subset of PII that if lost, compromised, or disclosed without authorization could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to an individual. To determine whether information is PII, DHS will perform an assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be identified using the information with other information that is linked or linkable to the individual. In performing this assessment, it is important to recognize that information that is not PII can become PII whenever additional information becomes available, in any medium or from any source, that would make it possible to identify an individual. Certain data elements are particularly sensitive and may alone present an increased risk of harm to the individual.\n\n40\n\n70CMSD25Q00000007 Attachment # 2 Statement of Work (SOW)\n\n(i) Examples of stand-alone PII that are particularly sensitive include: Social Security numbers (SSNs), driver\u2019s license or State identification numbers, Alien Registration Numbers (A-numbers), financial account numbers, and biometric identifiers.",

To determine whether information is PII, the DHS will perform an assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be identified using the information with other information that is linked or linkable to the individual. In performing this assessment, it is important to recognize that information that is not PII can become PII whenever additional information becomes available, in any medium or from any source, that would make it possible to identify an individual. Certain data elements are particularly sensitive and may alone present an increased risk of harm to the individual.\n\n(i) Examples of stand-alone PII that are particularly sensitive include: Social Security numbers (SSNs), driver\u2019s license or State identification numbers, Alien Registration Numbers (A-numbers), financial account numbers, and biometric identifiers.",

PII refers to information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual\u2019s identity, either alone, or when combined with other information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual; and SPII is a subset of PII that if lost, compromised, or disclosed without authorization could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to an individual. To determine whether information is PII, the DHS will perform an assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be identified using the information with other information that is linked or linkable to the individual. In performing this assessment, it is important to recognize that information that is not PII can become PII whenever additional information becomes available, in any medium or from any source, that would make it possible to identify an individual. Certain data elements are particularly sensitive and may alone present an increased risk of harm to the individual.\n\n(1) Examples of stand-alone PII that are particularly sensitive include: Social Security numbers (SSNs), driver\u2019s license or State identification numbers, Alien Registration Numbers (A-numbers), financial account numbers, and biometric identifiers.",
